This is the R codes which were used to generate figures and conduct the downstream analysis in our manuscript,
"Functional Specialization of Human Salivary Glands and Origins of Proteins Intrinsic to Human Saliva".

We mainly used R, Rstudio and Rpackage "ggplot2"

We took care to annotate our code and most input files can be created by saving the supplementary figures provided in our manuscript as .csv files. We seperate individual analyses and figures so that they can be more easily accessed. Given that we are biologists and not software engineers, our code is far from optimized. Moreover, the full replication  will still require some level of involvement given that we used some external data sources as well, which are not provided (e.g., RefSeq and Ensembl gene databases, GTEX gene expression data, etc.). Please contact Marie Satiou (mariesaitou@gmail.com) or Omer Gokcumen (gokcumen@gmail.com) if you have any questions. We like to thank Fatih Aksel, who patiently helped us to organize our code.
