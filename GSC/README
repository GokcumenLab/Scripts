block_bootstrap:
	the folder containing the GSC tools (python scripts)

python.slurm
	The command I used for the simulation. 
	python block_bootstrap/block_bootstrap.py -1 [exon] -2 [deletion file] -d [domain] -r 0.02 -n 1000 -v -t cc > [output]

exon.bed
	the BED file of refSeq exons.

domain.bed
	the "domain" file. It depict the genomic range where simulation can be made. This file covers all regions of the Hg19
	genome excluding the seqencing gap and the 1KG deletions.

domain2
	not used at the end of the day. It's also a domain file, but it only exclude the gaps, not the 1KG deletions. 

deletion & shuffled files:
	the deletion files of different categories were defined by out study. The shuffled file were made using shuffleBed (
	excluding gap and 1KG deletion when shuffling) and were used as controls.

simulation_output
	the output of ancient, introgressed, and human-specific deletion simulations. The test used for all these simulation 
	is Pearsn correlation.
